# RNN-LSTM

Trying to use RNN LSTM model to predict the Google stock price

This model is using the real world data: 
* Google stock price from 2012 - 2017

Using the google stock price on 2017 and to predict the 2012 - 2016 google stock price see if it work out.

I jsut found out using more **LSTM layers** is not as effectiveness as just add more **Dense layers**.

This model's error is ***0.0011710058432966902***

Knowing more about **RNN**:
